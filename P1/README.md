For the final project you will use web programming technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, and React) to build your application. In P1, you will learn how to use HTML/CSS to create a custom interface layout and styling.

What will you learn in this assignment?

**At the end of this assignment you will be able to:**

Use HTML/CSS to achieve a custom interface layout
Use HTML/CSS to achieve custom interface styling
Preview your web projects in different form factors

**Assignment Task: Making a Mobile-friendly Interface Layout [Individual]**

To create an interface, you will plan out your design using low-fidelity prototyping (e.g., sketching, wireframing), but eventually you will need to translate those **low fidelity prototypes into code**. In this task, you'll practice **translating a mockup that we give you into HTML/CSS**. For this task, we recommend using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), a library that provides a grid-based layout system as well as decent defaults for text, button, and input element styling.

* Review this [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Vf98TH0IJjJ1AmMe7GuL9ITiIGvaPl-SUJYPAVb4eY/edit?usp=sharing) on HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and viewing your work in different form factors.
* Download and start with the base codes:  [index.html](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1359081/files/70405246?wrap=1) & [style.css](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1359081/files/70325849?wrap=1)  You can put both in the same directory to preview the stylized website.
* Create an HTML/CSS site that features a menu that matches the menu mockup here Links to an external site..
  * The layout of your menu site should match the layout in the menu mockup. 
  * Your menu site should preserve the layout when viewed on most modern smartphone screens (i.e. do not use "absolute" positioning).
  * You must follow the requirements in the tutorial (layout, stylized text, images, and stylized buttons).
  * Extra styling to make your menu aesthetically appealing is optional.
 * Publish the site to "https://<your_github_ID>.github.io/cs378-p1/"

**What to Submit:**

In a text box on Canvas, you will include the following information:

1. The URL for your GitHub Pages menu (e.g., "https://<your_github_ID>.github.io/cs378-p1/")
2. Self-reflection [200 words or less]: What is one thing you would improve about the appearance of this interface? How would you go about improving it?
